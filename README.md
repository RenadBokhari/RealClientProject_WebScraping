# RealClientProject_WebScraping
This Project is a Real Client Project for Web Scraping. We scraped data from Laurent Ferrier website for watches.

There are 4 files: 

1- Script :  The core file, that contains the python code for scraping data processing from the website.

2- requirements : Contains all liberaries that will need for scraping, like Pandas.

3- init.sh : shell script that performs several steps to add a new repository and install Python 3.9 on an Ubuntu-based system. 

4- project_webScraping_Group2 : This file contains the result of websraping, so you will find all data that we scpraped orgines in appropriate columns.
